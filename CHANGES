1.2.0

Codename: "Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes"

* fixes potential issues with icon paths
* replaces Courier with Lucida in terminals
* replaces `firefox-esr` with `firefox` in menus
* reformats resource files so they might even be readable

IMPORTANT: if you use `make install`, any changes in `$HOME/.config/pirix`
are OVERWRITTEN, so you will lose any tweaks you have made in there.
If you want to keep your edits, bring changes in by hand.
